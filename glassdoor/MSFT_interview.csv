The coding problem was to implement a linked list. I passed that interview and was flown out to Seattle for final round interviews. They pay for everything they can and then reimburse you for everything else, including food and a small stipend for site seeing, so the trip was great. The day of the interview everyone showed up at 7:30am for a quick breakfast (fruit, rolls, bagels, etc) in a common area. There were about 40 other candidates being interviewed during that time. About 60% female, 40% male. And about 60% Indian, 25% Asian, and 15% Caucasian. Then we each had four 45 minutes interviews, with 15 minute breaks between each one. Two of the interviewers are from one team in Microsoft and the other two are from another team. They make hiring decisions independent of one another so you could theoretically get offers from both teams (or none). Of the four of us interview candidates from my university, we all seemed to be interview by entirely different teams.

He also asked me about my last three rounds and what I thought went well or what I could have done better.

One last thing is have a lot of questions prepared: what exactly is the role's duties, what is the org structure, what is the deployment cycle and workflow. Even questions like what was their worst deployment and what happened shows an interest in how the team operates (not all questions have to be interviewer pleasing!) Above all, treat the interview like a conversation between new acquaintances/friends. They want to gauge if they want to sit in an office/cubicle across from you everyday, so that interest and camaraderie is important to them as much as it is to you.

If it's a system development role, you need to brush up on your OS fundamentals, networking etc. Finally, prepare for any behavioral questions you could be asked.

I was then scheduled for 3 skype interviews in succession for 30 minutes each. Each interview was with a different person within the Fargo branch. The interview process went very well and I received an offer. My negative experience was associated with the background check. They use an outside organization called TrueScreen to compile their background checks for them. They proved to be very unaccommodating to the schedule of a busy college student. The questions on the background check were very unclear and caused issues in the process, which led to many phone calls and emails for clarifying information and additional paperwork, such as W-2's. Apparently, they had called my former places of work and were unable to get in contact with a few of my former bosses. However, when I called my bosses to see what happened, they said they had never received a call in the first place. This all led to negative areas on my background check, which the Microsoft background check review team rejected. They then rescinded my offer. Learn from my experience and be very thorough and detailed on your background check. They are extremely unforgiving and expect every detail to be perfect. Do not delay them in their process either. When they call, drop everything you are doing and answer right away. It was very clear that they did not like to wait and expected you to put down everything you were doing, no matter how important, to answer their questions. I would often be at class and work and couldn't answer right away, and they would call 3 times in a 3-hour span. If you make them wait too long, they will view you as a nuisance and will be unforgiving when compiling your report. They are extremely detail oriented to the point of absurdity. Treat it like another interview. You still have to be on top of your game. All in all, I had a very poor background check experience. Although I had an offer and was qualified for the job and had nothing on my background check beside 2 petty misdemeanors (the legal equivalent of a traffic ticket) they rescinded my offer. I had talked to my recruiter before the background check process to see her opinion on if the petty misdemeanors would affect my chances, and she told me that the charges I had were common and had not hindered other candidates from being hired. Learn from my mistakes and realize these guys aren't messing around. You're just a name on a page to them, so don't give them a reason to not like you. I must clarify my interview was great and was conducted wonderfully. My only complaint is with TrueScreen.""]","[' How will you approach taking over 80 phone calls a day? \xa0 ', '1 Answer']"

The broad questions were: Why do you want to work at Microsoft, What would you bring to Microsoft, What department do you want to work in and why, and what Microsoft technology are you interested and how would you improve it. I hadn\'t thought about any of these things and I was mostly doing the interview to get practice, which the interviewer picked up on immediately. Within the first ten minutes he asked me ""do you really want this internship?"", I was honest and the dynamic of the interview changed to him giving me helpful feedback after my crappy flustered answers. Anyway, the behavioral questions were tough (for me since I didn\'t prepare): what makes you better at coding then the other 15 people I am about to interview, why do you think you are qualified for this job, what is your style of writing code, why should I hire you. The technical part began with him asking me to write a function that returns the number of coins to make change for a given input value. It was very ambiguous so I asked a bunch of questions and easily got a whole lot more information. I was able to write a function that worked, making it the only section I hadn\'t bombed yet. I was then asked to test out a function that was supposed to do the same thing (number of coins) and figure out what was wrong with it. I was only given 5 inputs that I wasted stupidly by not putting in a currency. Needless to say I didn\'t do well but overall the interview was a good experience because I received a lot of helpful feedback.

The first contact via phone was with the recruiter herself, which lasted roughly a half hour and was very high-level, general interest and experience questions.', 'After the initial interview via phone, I was contacted roughly one week later requesting a single phone interview with the hiring manager. The hiring manager phone interview was then scheduled about 1 week later, and in between the recruiter was quite adequate at contacting me and answering questions. The hiring manager phone interview was very much like the recruiter phone interview with some technical questions but more intensive and formal overall.', 'I was contacted a couple days after the hiring manager phone interview with news that the team was interested in having me come in. The soonest available date was about 2 weeks out, so I had some time in between where I did not hear much from the team at Microsoft. Finally, I was sent a packet of information via email to fill out before the in-person interview, and was given instructions.', ""The day of the interview was quite grueling. I met with 5 different people not including the recruiter, and each person seemed to test/focus on a different facet of my experience, skills, or personality. The first person I really clicked with: we talked over lunch about my experience, why I was interested in the role, and what I thought I could bring to the team. The second person was much more technical and asked specific task questions including abstract ideas and problem solving cases that might come up in the role I was applying for. This was the most difficult interviewer by far! The third person was a younger manager on the team, and he asked some experience questions and questions seeming to aim at personality traits as well as some technical questions - however, nowhere near as technical as the second person. The final person in the loop was brought in at the last minute and she was a senior manager on the same team. This person did not take notes or have a schedule to her interview, but asked difficult questions and was kind of 'cold' in general."", 'Looking back, I am glad I had the experience to interview, but I do understand why I did not get the job. At Microsoft, it is not enough to be a fast learner, you really need to be able to hit the ground running and if you do not fit the role 100% you will not get an offer.

Before I stepped into the office, I got the e-mail request for me to fly to Seattle and meet the team the following week. Scheduling was very easy to work with and I had no issues getting to Seattle; a rental car was even booked for me, and meals and parking can be expensed. The first interview was with the recruiter, who was very friendly and provided some insightful information on how the interviews work and a schedule with the people I would meet. She also mentioned that there were multiple teams monitoring these interviews and that if I did well in the interviews there would be additional interviews that were not on the schedule. While there was a lunch interview that was a bit more casual (no whiteboard = no coding), I didn't let my guard down; all other interviews were highly technical and required coding or analyzing code. I eventually met double the number of people I was scheduled for and the interviews lasted 7 hours. It was a gruelling day, and one interviewer asked me questions outside of my knowledge zone, but it was extremely insightful as to the difficulty level of a first-tier software tech company interview, and I learned a lot of what was being expected at Microsoft.""]","[' Implement a stack. \xa0 ', '1 Answer']"

My 2nd interview was a technical loop with Sr SDE, about which I will discuss later in a separate paragraph.

She asked me a TSQL question on white board, which I resolved in like 5 sec, she then got surprised and tried to made it complicated, I resolved that too quickly, then she asked me what if each of these intervals are dynamic in nature, I resolved that too, she told me it will not work, I told her lets test to check and it worked. She accepted that it will work. Then she asked me ranking function related TSQL question, which again I resolved in 10 sec, she then asked me how you will test it. I told her about 7/8 test cases and how you can write all these in VS DB unit testing project. My resume has lot of other stuff like Big data, Machine learning, Python, Java and data science. It was very clear that she didn't had any experience with any of these as she completely ignored asking any question related to these. She then asked me how you will predict sales amount for our product, which is very open ended question, I talked about it for like 10 min(discussed different feature selection, model selection and validation tech and challenges around curse of dimensionality and how to take care of it) and it became clear that she didn't understood what I am talking and also she didn't asked me a single follow up question. Only question she asked me, how much out of these I have implemented. With her facial expression and postures I became sure that she didn't came prepared for interview and she also don't know much about ML/data science/Datawarehouse/Big Data/MPP and analytical technologies, for which she was supposed to interview me. She then asked me do you know .NET(not listed on my resume). I said no I don't , but then she replied, oh you know Java( I said yes as it was on my resume, expecting some follow up algorithm question or oop question), but she didn't asked me any question related to algorithm or OOP.

Had a phone screen with a principal engineer in the same project. No coding questions were asked but had a great conversation on network management, latency and my work in general. Was scheduled for an onsite interview after 2 weeks. Had a short phone call with the recruiter the day before the interview on what to expect during the day. I was told that 3 rounds of 1:1 interviews were scheduled with a potential for that to be extended to two more rounds. Was specifically told that more than 3 interviews is considered a good sign. The recruiter also promised to get back within 48 hours with the result.', 'First round of interviews was with a principal engineer. He let me use his development system to code. Along with the main coding question, was given two additional code snippets to find bugs/issues. All three problems were not overly had but had plenty of areas which lead to software design discussions. The next was a lunch interview with was very pleasant. Had an opportunity to talk about both work and life in Seattle. The last 30 mins were dedicated to a system design/requirements gathering question and was also asked to pseudo code the algorithm at the end. Third round was with the hiring manager. Was asked to go deep into a mutual exclusion problem that i had coded around 5 years ago. I had forgotten a lot of finer details of it and was finding it hard to recollect. He let that pass and asked me a coding question that i was able to code. The 4th round was with one of his peers. The hour was mostly spend on OS fundamentals with a coding problem at the end.', ""Had a good experience overall and i was happy with my performance. Waited 3 days for the recruiter to let me know the result but all i got was radio silence. Had to convince myself that i didn't make it after waiting for a week. I guess their hiring standards are really high. One advice for other folks is to brush up on their past work to as much detail as possible. I felt i had missed out on the interview with the Hiring manager where i couldn't go deep into my past work. Another helpful tip is to ask as many clarifying questions as possible to their coding problems. Every one in the interview including the Hiring manager are able to device a problem on the spot and leave the details to us. It really helps to nail down the details before staring to code. Also beware that they can stop you at any time and pose a specific assumption for the problem that makes you change your approach and re-think all over again.""]","[' Cant share questions Signed NDA. \xa0 ', '2 Answers']"

They flew me across country out to Washington state for a face to face all day meeting. The time difference combined with a full day of interviews was draining to say the least. I interviewed with eight different people. Everything went fine until I interviewed with one guy who was also pegged to be my lunch date for the day. It seems that he was in some kind of political battle with the two managers that wanted to hire me. They warned me ahead of time that he may be difficult. The entire lunch was spent fielding technical questions...most of which were benign..and I began to feel that the job description i had been given wasn\'t the job being interviewed for. Went I returned, I had to wait in a meeting room while I was being ""discussed"". One thing you will note when you interview here, you will interview with a lot of people and after each interview they will leave you in a room while they talk about you. Also, during many interviews, the interviewer will instant message other interviewers and triangulate your answers with what you have told others. Its very distracting and unprofessional if you ask me. That\'s something they need to stop. I then met with the hiring manager who was red faced and stated that he had a heated conversation with the guy who took me to lunch. I then interviewed with a couple other people who\'s job it was to find out if I could be placed anywhere else. I didn\'t get a job. A few months later, I went thru the process again for another job. Again I had a phone screen that went well, two phone screens in fact. I noted that the manager I talked to seemed a bit down. I later found out he was being demoted. Anyway, they paid again to fly me across country, put me up in a hotel, give me a rental car, and keep me onsite for a day\'s worth of interviews. I didn\'t get hired this time either. The problem with microsoft is the culture...it doesn\'t fit with any other IT company I\'ve worked for. Most employees are young and inexperienced, or have been with the company their entire lives. They have little or no knowledge of the IT industry in general or other technologies outside of microsoft. The project managers I met with didn\'t know anything that a project manager should, such as what a RFP is, SOW, PMP, etc. The technical guys only spoke in a microsoft context. They said they had worked with other technologies, such as linux, but in talking with them it was clear they had not. The worst was the job descriptions...they are unclear and don\'t represent what the job is really about, which is also a bit unclear. In the first set of interviews, I thought it was a senior engineer or architect position but it turned out to be nothing more than a 3rd tier technical support job for operations. Nothing I would really have been interested in. I also can\'t believe they spent so much money bringing me out twice and didn\'t do a better job of interviewing.

If you know anything at all, this is a piece of cake. The remainder of this review describes my on-site experience.', 'Regarding travel arrangements: I experienced a flight cancellation for my return journey, but the travel team was very supportive and helpful, extending my hotel stay and rebooking my flight.', 'Regarding the interviews: most of the advice and information available here and elsewhere online is quite accurate (just note that they generally do NOT ask “mount Fuji” questions anymore), and as there is a lot of it (if you are unable or too lazy to find it you certainly do not deserve an offer from any company) I will only give a brief outline of my experience.', 'I arrived at the recruiting building in my rental car and managed to find a single open parking spot. After checking in at the desk, I had about 15 minutes to hang out in the lobby area with around 12 other candidates. They provide free drinks, xbox, and some weird machines running a program called something like “tell us about yourself,” which I tried to use unsuccessfully. The recruiter took me to an office where we spent about 15 minutes going over the day, some interview advice, and a little about my goals and background; nothing technical or difficult.', 'The first 30 minutes of my first “real” interview consisted of discussing his and my background and me asking lots of questions about the product since I had never heard of it. The remaining 30 minutes were filled by a problem on sorting: design, complexity, and pseudocode. He had a somewhat similar background so we had no trouble connecting. Next was my lunch interview at a nearby cafeteria. There was a wide selection of reasonably priced food (though I had a voucher for a free lunch). I decided on a salad for ease of eating. We talked about the company, the team and my goals. Back in his office, I worked out two problems on trees coded up in C++. The next interview was entirely coding; two of the questions were easy but the third gave me trouble; it was the craziest recursion I’ve ever seen. Make sure you practice with trees a lot, and don’t bother much with general graphs. The interviewer gave me lots of tips, and I finished the code at the last minute. The fourth interview was more like the earlier ones; relatively informal conversation in the first half followed by a technical question, in this case design. I had to design a data structure to represent the state of a game. Pretty open ended… I think the idea is just to have a dialog about design tradeoffs (memory vs. speed and so on). Finally I was happy to make it to the last interview with an upper level person which involved more discussion of the team and my past experiences—no technical questions. Be sure to have something to say about every item on your resume—difficulties you encountered, what you learned, etc. I briefly met the recruiter again and went back to the hotel. In a few days, I heard the good news from the recruiter.', 'So my advice is: 1) ask questions, be curious, and be enthusiastic about the team/product and the company. If you are having a “conversation“ and not just a dry Q&A, then you are probably doing this well. 2) spend a few minutes verbalizing your ideas before writing any code. 3) don’t code silently. 4) practice coding on paper or a whiteboard before the interview--preferably with someone watching over your shoulder. It really helps! 5) try to learn something from each interview, anything, then use it in a later interview; ESPECIALLY if the interviewer specifically gives you advice. They want you to succeed. Remember this if you get nervous.', 'This is mostly drawn from advice I’ve heard elsewhere, but I found it to be particularly useful. Good Luck! Also, everyone I encountered at Microsoft was very nice and personable.

This was my second interview with Microsoft. Back in 2008, I interviewed for an SDET position for which I received an offer and graciously accepted. I voluntarily left the company 2 years later because I did not enjoy my work as an SDET. Contrary to what the recruiter will tell you, it's quite difficult to move around within the company once you're there. I've found that it's actually much easier to just leave the company and come back on your own terms -- which is pretty much how I did it. Although one piece of advice there: make sure you have a rock star record before leaving because they save that stuff and will review it if you return. This was a bridge that I made absolutely sure *not* to burn on my way out."", ""I was contacted by an MSFT recruiter about an SDE position. I did an initial phone interview with someone. He was quite personable and asked me a lot of questions about things on my resume. There was one particular personal side-project that he thought was interesting and we discussed it at great depth for maybe 45 minutes. The questions didn't feel quizzical, but rather like he was actually interested and engaged in what I had done."", ""Then he asked some basic work related questions around how the file system at my current company works. Next, we did some coding in a shared document. This part wasn't bad. He asked me to insert a node in to a binary search tree (BST) and then balance it. All in all, I wrote the code to insert a node, get current balance of the tree, determine the current height of any node, and the rotate_left and rotate_right functions in the case where a rotation is needed to restore the balance. It was around 120 lines of code give or take. All done in the C programming language. Not bad. The bottom line in any interview is that if it's on your resume, it's fair game."", 'Then they brought me on campus for a full round of interviews. They scheduled me to talk to 4 different folks which were on an itinerary that they gave to me in the lobby when I walked in. What they don\'t tell you though is that each interviewer is a gate-keeper to the next, so if at any point in time you don\'t do well, then it\'s ""game over"". If, however, you do well, you\'ll end up finishing the entire schedule, plus doing at 2-3 additional bonus interviews. I went in around 9:30 and left some time after 5. Keep in mind that this doesn\'t mean that you\'ll receive an offer, but if you\'re shown the door before you finish (minimally) what\'s on your schedule, that\'s probably a bad sign.', 'I went in there with my coding weapons off safety -- but I didn\'t feel like I was grilled as thoroughly (technically) as I should have been. I was asked a lot of design questions mostly around locking, thread synchronization, and scheduling, data compression and snapshot operations on file systems. All in all, I didn\'t have any trouble with anything and the interviews felt more like a conversation about the things that I am passionate about. I expected to write more code than they asked me to -- and certainly I was prepared. Each interviewer will make a recommendation to the next on where to focus their attention in an attempt to find a weakness -- similarly, they\'ll also recommend areas to skip if your skill level in that particular area is already of known (good) quantity. They\'re constantly probing in different places throughout the day, scanning for a weakness, and if you\'re strong in something, my observation has been that they will adjust their approach (as opposed to continuing to set\'em up and allowing you to knockin\'em down). I demolished the first couple of coding problems early on and I think that\'s why they changed vantage points to a most holistic approach -- they wanted to know if I could see the ""big picture"". At one point in the day, I even asked for another coding problem at which point, I was politely declined. So then I offered to give them one instead. Again, denied, lol.', ""My day ended sometime between 5pm and 6pm. I can't exactly remember what time it was (perhaps 5:30), but it was dark out (and cold!). Having done it twice now, the one best piece of advice I'd give to anyone is to get a lot of sleep the night before, rather than study. Studying the night before won't save you. :) Regardless of the technical level of difficulty, this process can be quite nerve-racking.
