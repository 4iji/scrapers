Terrible and dishonest HR - the worst I've seen in a long time."", ""Got called for an on-site interview after applying. Arrived there in the morning and met with the recruiter, who took me and a group of other candidates to their main cafeteria / restaurant where we ate before the interviews started. After a while the recruiter just disappeared and we got worried because it was about time to start interviewing. We went back to the main lobby and had the receptionist call the recruiter to meet us again (this was weird). So, recruiter shows up again out of nowhere, takes us into a conference room and shows us videos about Yahoo on YouTube. I was expecting to have a (brief) office tour, but it never happened, so apparently it wasn't part of the plans. Anyone can see videos about Yahoo at home, so I'm not sure what's the point here. Then some developers arrived and we all split for 1:1 interviews in conference rooms. The interviews were standard software engineering coding questions (algorithms, data structures, design patterns, ...) and each interview lasted 45 minutes. I did 3 interviews and then they said we were done for the day and that the recruiter would reach out soon."", ""Despite my follow-up e-mails, the recruiter simply ignored me. It took the recruiter about a month to reply. I assumed they weren't interested in moving forward, but turns out I was wrong. Recruiter said I did really well and that they would prepare an offer package and present it to the Hiring Committee. I though this was good: yes, HR was kind of inefficient, but the office looked nice and I enjoyed interviewing there, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. And then the wait again... it was another full month until the recruiter reached out (despite my efforts, recruiter kept ignoring my follow-up e-mails) to say that the package offer was approved by the committee. They sent me the offer, which was conditional on getting a US visa. They also mentioned that I could work from their office in London if I didn't get the visa for some reason, since I don't need a visa to work in London. I accepted the offer."", 'Then I waited a couple of months while Yahoo was taking care of preparing my visa petition. I eventually got confirmation that the petition had been sent to USCIS (the government office in the US that approves / denies visa applications). Apparently there is a year cap on the number of visas, and there are more applicants than the allotted number, so USCIS just runs a lottery to see who gets a visa.', ""For 4 months, I waited for someone to reach out to me with some updates. I got tired of waiting and reached out to the immigration attorney that prepared my petition, who informed me that I didn't make it in the lottery, and also that Yahoo had mentioned that I wouldn't be joining the company anyway the month before (so that's why the attorney didn't tell me about the lottery results)."", ""I got pissed off and immediately e-mailed my prospective manager at Yahoo, who said the same: that the recruiting department said I wouldn't be joining the company any more. I also got to know that they didn't have a place for me in London because the team I was working with was in Sunnyvale (CA)."", ""I'm really sad about what happened; I really expected a lot more from a company like Yahoo.

That there is little trust from higher ups and from my experience, no one seems to know what is going on. Specially if you are applying for a team that was part of a recently acquired startup, higher ups have little trust or faith in their hiring managers picking candidates. If you're a good engineer I would suggest trying other tech companies. I applied to Yahoo in July 2015 and they managed to waste two months of my life."", 'Here is my story:', 'I got a phone call from one of their hiring managers a few days after I applied. He asked me some general technical questions which I answered. He then set up a second technical phone screen with one of his engineers for the following week. They called me on time and we conducted the second technical phone interview. The challenge was to code up a simple Javascript game with another engineer watching. After I got that one done I was invited for an on site interview. At this point I got in touch with a recruiter which asked me what day would work best for me, after I gave her my preferred schedule, she organized my on site interview a week after that, without even double checking with me.', ""I didn't have anything going on for that date so I figure she probably confused one Friday with another. Anyways I show up for the on site and get interviewed by five engineers. This is was the most pleasant part of the process. The engineers I talked to were friendly, knowledgeable and professional. There were two coding questions and three design related ones. I answered every single question to the best of my knowledge and the people who were interviewing me seemed to be happy."", ""After the interview was done I met with the recruiter who was responsible for recruiting for the team that I was interviewing for. This guy was different than the woman who I originally talked to for the on site interview. he took me out to URLs (Yahoo's cafeteria) and told me the interviewers were happy with my performance and there is high chance of moving my application forward with the hiring committee. He then told me he was an amazing recruiter and that he has never had anyone rejected by the hiring committee after he was done with their offer proposal. He then gave me his personal phone number and told me that he is going to call me soon."", 'A week later he called me and told me that the feedback from everyone was positive and that Yahoo will move my application forward to the hiring committee. He told me this would take some time as higher ups and more specifically Marissa Mayer has to sign off on every new hire. I was told I can expect to hear from them in two weeks.', 'Then I notice the position I had applied for was being advertised again on LinkedIn. I called the recruiter and asked him ""How is the process on my application is coming along."" He literally yelled at me and said "" I\'m your goddamn recruiter, I don\'t process applications."" Then he said I will call you later', '""We are going to to need another technical phone interview."" why do we another interview, I asked him.

I am currently employed and cannot keep taking time off to conduct more interview He said ""This is normal and 1/3 of candidates have to go through it.""', 'We set up a technical phone interview. I get the call and we conduct the interview. The guy interviewing me is professional and knowledgeable but has no idea why he is interviewing me. He says they called him yesterday and told him he needs to interview someone. He asks me two general coding questions which I answer correctly. He seems happy with the result and he hangs up.', ""At this point I know there is no reason to call the recruiter because he has no interest in talking to me. However the hiring manager that originally contacted me was always prompt and friendly in his response. So I email him and ask him if we're done? The recruiter calls me ten minutes later and tells me that I did not do well on the last technical phone interview and that we were not going to move forward with the offer."", 'I was fairly disappointed when I heard that, even though I knew it was coming. It is my opinion, the last out of nowhere phone interview was not to gauge my abilities as an engineer, it was for the hiring committee to sink my application without having to tell the seven other people who interviewed me, ""We don\'t trust your judgment, and have no faith in your ability to form a team.""', ""Anyways, It's now Oct 29th 2015.

So during my on-site I interviewed with the Homepage team but they thought I was a programmer. I am also based out of Los Angeles, and they flew me to Sunnyvale for my 3 'on-site' interviews but one of my interviews was a conference call to a guy in Santa Monica... Los Angeles. So pretty much 1/3 was a complete waste of an 'on-site' purpose (and in my opinion, a waste of time)... As for the other two interviewers, one couldn't have seemed less interested. It seemed like I was originally scheduled with his boss but he got pulled in/switched at the last minute - so my interviewer basically came to the interview with zero questions prepared. The third interviewer was in a completely different team entirely, and again thought I was technical. At the end of the day we were told they would get back within 7-10 days. I interviewed on November 1st, and didn't officially hear back until December 3rd. I had to follow up several times and even find out through a different recruiter because everyone else was clueless and unresponsive. To top things off, they haven't reimbursed my (very few) travel expenses yet and it has been almost 2 months. They finally submitted my payment so it's only just processing now. There was no transparency or organization among recruiters, the team, hiring managers or the interviewers. It was a disaster."", 'Update: (1/6/2014) my reimbursement finally came, after interviewing on November 1st (2013), Yahoo finally reimbursed interview expenses... it took 2 months.
