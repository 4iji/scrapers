For example, ""Stay Fit"" gym or exercise equipment reimbursement, on-campus health care facility, tuition reimbursement. Spouse health care covered at no additional cost. Overall pretty good, not as good as Google/FB. Vacation time is too stingy compared to Google/FB. Worst thing: health plan has been downgraded in the past year or so. We used to have a good health plan that would cover everything; now he have to choose between the Kaiser HMO (you know, worthless, shithole ""you don\'t deserve to live so we won\'t pay your bills; no, you don\'t need the medication your doctor prescribed"" HMOs -- always have been and will be utter trash) and a health plan thing that pays nothing until you hit $4000 per year, and then starts paying for stuff. No nice plan that actually pays for 90%+ of all expenses from the get-go like other big tech companies have. Dental is bad, but it\'s bad everywhere. Vision is not as good as other big tech companies. Current CFO, Amy Hood, is actively trying to reduce health care coverage to save $$, because she likes $$ and hates human beings, apparently.']"

However the salary package is downright unacceptable. There is a base salary and then there are benefits i.e. stock options that are tied to the package. The annual reviews which are not 360 degrees are not even 270 degrees. They are just 180 degrees. So its ultimately the nature of the relationship and performance and perception that reckons your annual review number. Now this number has no direct co-relation with your salary because the entire organization performance is subject to curve fitting.The number of stock options that would be then awarded for that review period would also be derived as a result of this curve fitting. The nature of the curve or its rationale is not (obviously) disclosed so at the end of the review drama the increments on the salary always left one disappointed. The stock options were ok, just ok.

Standard dental and eye coverage. They have a wellness clinic on the Redmond campus that accepts the HMO health plan, which can be a major convenience (including chiro).

Where Microsoft goes above and beyond is with the tech benefits. You get full MSDN membership, free certification tests, access to company sponsored tech conferences where you can meet power players, and learn from the industry leaders directly. The company also incentivizes you to create IP and content which creates and develops the community around many of our technologies. Finally there are discounts on Microsoft branded items, company funded fitness incentives (i.e. fitness equipment, biotrackers, gym memberships, personal trainer reimbursement, etc), company programs to keep you aware of your health as well as provide you the means to improve it, and a general effort to keep our staff very healthy.

The med package is either Group Health (HMO) or Premera with a high deductible. The high deductible package was implemented in 2013 and is essentially $2500 deductible for single, $3750 for family. Microsoft contributed fully the first year, and partially the 2nd year. Not sure what 2015 will have. Once you make your deductible, you pay 10%. So a prescription that\'s $500 costs you $50. Many drugs are covered 100%, such as BP meds. For cobra, the Premera plan isn\'t that good, but if you\'re getting subsidized for the deductible, it\'s ok. The previous ""Cadillac"" plan paid 100% of all medical, except name drugs when generic were available. That was pulled due to obamacare taxes (at least that was the explanation in 2011). You also get gym membership where you only pay the income tax on the cost (approx. $15-25 a month). The main gym is the Pro Club, a seriously upscale place. You can get ARAG legal package for approx. $16 a month. This can cover many legal needs, such as wills and divorces. If you\'re working there, it\'s not a bad benefit package.
