I saw how insightful, professional, and knowledgeable these Yahoos were, and as a struggling intern at the time, brand new to Search, I instantly wanted to become like those wonderful Yahoos. At my next ad agency in a different part of the country, the Yahoo team worked even more closely with ours, confirming to me that there was a common value shared among Yahoos all over the world. I knew I had to come here myself when it came time for my next challenge. It was the Yahoo team that taught me about how to succeed in a changing marketplace, demonstrated exceptional customer service, and made me proud to eventually get a job on the vendor side. Yahoo reps roll up our sleeves and teach our clients, we empower them to be self-sufficient in our platforms, and customize trainings to help them succeed. If you care about your work, you will feel recognized and supported at Yahoo by your peers and managers, too.<br><br>Yahoo is one of the most generous, fun companies I have ever worked. The most important difference about my day-to-day coming from the agency side, was new autonomy--not a single soul micromanaged me in my 16 months at Yahoo. There was also no drama within my teams. I was given creative freedom to drive the businesses in my portfolio to fit my clients' needs and had a strong, capable, efficient support team of Ad Ops and Creative Strategists to grow those businesses. I was given responsibilities to strengthen my insecurities and had 1:1 with my manager weekly throughout the course of my Yahoo life. I had time in weekly team meetings to ask questions, present wins and challenges, and make an impact for my peers. My ideas were valued from Day 1, and even only after 7 months of work, I had the chance to apply and was selected to fly to London for a Global Exchange program. I worked in the Yahoo UK office for 3 weeks, which was not only a significant career booster, but yet another personal accomplishment I had dreamed of for years. I don't know any other company that would support such an initiative for a relative newbie.<br><br>I wish this unique company the absolute very best. Despite the difficult press and evident struggles, Yahoo is a company that most consumers have a soft spot for--many grew up with Yahoo products and don't want to see it fail.","I was cut in the latest round of lay-offs, along with 90 others in my role.<br><br>Regardless, the folks working at Yahoo are true believers of Yahoo products; we even used Yahoo mail for corporate communications --a frequent pain point-- (no Outlook/calendar), but were also using integrated Google tools on a daily basis. Some may find it difficult or cumbersome to adapt to these tools, but the overall culture and people that work here make it all worth it.","Listen to the honest updates from your Sales team, which has direct communication and real-time feedback from clients. It is difficult to pitch products that continue encountering problems after leaving the beta mode. When products glitch, it is our integrity and personal reputation that customers begin doubting, which makes it difficult to rebuild relationships or grow business. Regardless, I am grateful for the opportunity and appreciate the generosity shown to me by my employer, managers and peers. G-d bless."

Yahoo has spent a decade squandering its future, and is now close to checkmate. Platitudes like 'mobile first' and 'delighting our customers' don't really address the systemic issues at this company. The recent foray into online gambling shows how desperate this company is to shore up its sagging revenue - the primary value of Yahoo is its stake in Alibaba and its Asian assets.<br><br>- Corporate ineptitude at its finest. The leadership is non-existent, and C-level leadership mixes incompetence with arrogance and lies. The CEO will tell you she doesn't force her leadership teams to stack rank employees, but ask any front-line manager, and you'll see this is a lie.<br><br>- QPRs...employees are evaluated on a quarterly basis. Sounds good, right? Not when the evaluations are stack ranked, and there's a forced distribution of achieves vs. misses. So if you're on a team of idiots, you're as good as gold...if you work on a team of smart achievers, you might draw the short straw. And make no mistake - that short straw will result in your termination at some point, or at the very least, you'll have to wait over a year for a raise or promotion. Since forced distribution is a zero sum game, it encourages employees to sabotage each other in an effort to avoid the ax.<br><br>- Ya-who? Not only is Yahoo somewhat of a joke in most of society, they are going through a painful, existential identity crisis. Of the last four CEOs, none has been able to coherently articulate an answer to ""What does Yahoo do?"".<br><br>- Layoffs. Yahoo has yet to improve its revenue, so the only other road to profitability is to cut expenses. That means cutting people. For a while in Q1, there were weekly layoffs - management doesn't have the guts to make a large cut, so they cut 20 here, 30 there and hope nobody notices. Everyone noticed.<br><br>- Lack of communication and transparency. Weekly 'FYI' meetings are supposed to allow employees a chance to ask questions of management - while great in theory, this is just a waste of an hour when the answers are glib coporatisms from the PR department, or complete avoidance of the actual question being asked. Q: 'What are you going to do about QPRs? They're destroying morale at Yahoo'. A: 'I fundamentally disagree, I think morale is great'. It sure is great if you're bringing in the millions in the C-suite! For the drones, maybe not as much.<br><br>- Terrible products. Try using Yahoo mail alongside Gmail. 'nuff said. Fantasy football is the one bright spot, but even that will probably crash just as you're about to draft your QB.","Resign. Now. Publicly. You're cool, Ken Goldman - you can stay. The rest of the C-suite should be ashamed of calling themselves leaders.<br><br>Maybe too harsh. Here are some real pieces of advice:<br><br>- Eliminate stack ranking and subsequent firings. It didn't work at GE or Microsoft. Doesn't seem to be working at Yahoo either.<br><br>- Stop buying companies that you won't actually monetize to their full potential. Brightroll? Sounds like a good acquisition. Tumblr? Try actually making some money off it!<br><br>- Roll back the regressive work at home policies. This is 2015, and you're (supposedly) an internet company. Webex works fine, and let's face it - the real impediment to collaboration is the toxic work culture, not people working from their homes.<br><br>- Develop a coherent and specific statement about what Yahoo is, and what it's going to do in the future. Want to be an internet company? Great. Want to be a media company? Awesome. Pick one and stick to it. And dump the 'mobile first' thing - that's the equivalent of saying 'as a company, we want to be relevant and make money'.

One of the core values was communication. Well, hope springs eternal. Too often the right had didn't know what the left hand was doing. Departments were siloed and had vested a vested interest in protecting their turf. The idea of ""One Yahoo!"" was floated for over a decade and will never come to fruition. Back in the day, we were a search company and our competition was Google. Then we became a media company, and our competition was Sony, EMI, and newspapers/magazines.

There's a general consensus that Marissa didn't tell the Board that she was pregnant before they hired her. She hired her BFF out of Portugal (before he had the legal right to work in the US, of course, cuz the laws don't apply to Marissa and her senior staff), and very publicly threw him under the bus when she could no longer deny that he was out of his league. She's made some lame hiring decisions, and she's made some really horrible hiring decisions. EVERY offer passes through at least one hiring committee, and then is scrutinized by Marissa. If she doesn't like the comp (and she often doesn't), she will reduce it to what she thinks is fitting and there is no appeal. She talks about hiring the best and the brightest but neither the best nor the brightest will surrender their right to negotiate their compensation. Anyone who does so cannot, by definition, be either the best or the brightest. Free food goes only so far. Oh, and cutting work from home while claiming that it only affected 100 people, most of whom, according to you, rarely logged into the network to actually work seems a little like overkill.

The company is operating with a sense of vision and urgency that hasn't been seen since it's very early days. What used to take 18 months to get done is now taking less than six. Having everyone work in the office everyday again instead of seeing random people working from home on any given day and on every Friday has made a big difference. With everyone working together in the office 5 days a week instead of 3-4 days a week the company overall is noticeably more productive now. The free food and free smartphones are great, but by far the best change that has happened since Marissa took over is seeing the company focus back on making user-centric products, instead of developing products primarily to satisfy the demands coming from advertisers. The culture of transparency exhibited at each Friday's all-hands meetings led by Marissa has been a breath of fresh air.","Despite all of the positive changes we've seen over the past year, there are still way, way too many managers. The company could eliminate 50% of the managers and there would still be too many managers.","Please consider how we can streamline the org chart so we can all work more efficiently.

Then you can get an idea of the environment.<br>The customer care department in Dublin is ran by a very BAD MANAGEMENT. I am not referring to the team leaders, who probably are as much slaves as the single specialists (better paid slaves, that is), but senior management. The only transparent thing in Yahoo is the effort senior management put into launching their “favourite” employees forward. They’re also very rude as they can’t be bothered to say goodbye to the frustrated “what’s their face” employees leaving the company but they find the time when their favourite ones “finally” get promoted to other departments. Call me naive but a company whose value is “transparency” should make more than an effort to hire better and more humble management.<br>Customer care specialists are treated as children, we were told what to do, how to do it, if we could laugh or not, what kind of jokes we could make, and if we were good enough we were given treats (like dogs).<br>Like it’s shown in any American high school movie the cool guys are always under the spotlight whereas the multitude of nerds, geeks and parias are deliberately left in the shadow, no matter how hard they work. HARD WORK IS NOT RECOGNIZED IN YAHOO! (At least not in the Dublin site and definitely not in customer care).<br>Salaries are low and not balanced to the average salaries for similar positions. Yahoo! management likes to brag we work for one of the biggest internet industries but they pay much less the direct competitors are paying their employees (for the same role). Within the team, employees with identical role have different salaries (depending on “experience”) and this cause uneasiness and bad feelings.<br>Customer care employees have been hired with the promise of email work only, b to b, but after signing the contract they were advised of some “small changes”: there would have been phone and it would have been a c to c support. And if you don’t like it there’s the door, paraphrasing what I was told when I complained about it.<br>You may think “oh well, I will stay in customer care for a while and I will apply to some internal position when it becomes available”, but you’re wrong. To apply for a position in a different department you have to be in the company for at least 1 year and a half and you have to have very high performances within your role (which is kind of difficult to get recognized for, if you’re not cool). But of course there are exceptional cases, it’s just not clear what is the criteria there, it’s like a leap of faith, you have to believe. In fact, apparently rules do not apply to everyone in Yahoo as I recently witnessed with my own eyes a person getting promoted to another department after less than one year. They say they made an exception. They just didn’t say why.<br>I’ve never felt so belittled as I did while working in Yahoo!<br>I don’t recommend this company, at least not the customer care department in Dublin. Unless you’re cool. Then it’s fine.",Try not to be biased by personal sympathies.

Like former CEO Bartz said ""actualy most people outside the east and west coast love the product"". This is just how things are and is relatively unique dichotomy. In that regards, it feels sometime that current management does not really understand the user base and does not manage the company to its strengths, i.e. the company has the best (ad) performing audience amongst all other big online media players, loyal as well because adverse to change, not eager to try disruptively new things but open to small new explorations of what the internet has to offer, wishing to stay in a technological confort zone, open and receptive to ads if not fooled by poor quality campaigns and shady advertisers. Trying to be like Google and frustrating its older and loyal users, the company has focused on changing products drastically and bringing new users before focusing on nurturing the existing base and bringing up the performance of their ad inventory. Increasing yield by 10% is much easier then increasing user base by 10%...at least by getting modern ad tech. This was typicaly exemplified by mail product manager claiming ""you'd need to kick the users in the balls to have them leave the platform"" (see business insider article) and by the fact that focus has been openly on increasing user base via better product rather then improving the outdated ad tech and ad user experience. Management is almost too smart and too silicon valleyish, googler point-of-view has some benefits in terms of bringing technological advances but does not seem in phase with the core of the product. So all-in-all my advice is: focus on getting best in-class ad tech products, hire a non-tech FMCG product manager from the south/midwest, understand how 30+ year old people use the internet outside of San Francisco, open a small office in Africa and get your big user growth, next big innovation and long-term perspective from there (as well as India/SEA), build your new young audiences on other platform / brand (e.g. Tumblr) while nurturing your current users."

"""I actually look forward to going to work every day!""",4.0,5.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,," Jun 11, 2008",Current,Business Analytics,Singapore (Singapore),Yes,Neutral,Yes,Full-time,,"First, I like working at Yahoo! because I get to see the results of my work in use by millions of people every day. By and large I think most of my fellow Yahoo!s really do work hard to live the company's values and truly love what they do. In the ranks of employees that I usually work with, the spirit of collaboration and willingness to share knowledge rule over all else, and being part of the solution rather than simply restating or avoiding the problem are things they excel at. I have experience in banking, financial services, healthcare, and consulting so I have a wide range of companies to compare my impressions to. After all of this time - some of it with companies considere among the very best of the best in their industries - Yahoo! is the first company I have worked with during my twenty year career where I wake up on most days and actually look forward to going to the office!","Of course there are challenges with working at a large company, such as lengthy decision-making processes and too much beauracracy, or senior managers who know - by choice or by ignorance - very little about how to really get things done or manage anything very effectively. But I have found these people at every company I have ever worked with. Yahoo! is no different, except that perhaps there is less of that here. No one should expect any company to be perfectly free from incompetence. Few companies I know can say they don't have a fair share of poor managers sprinked throughout their ranks, who seem to last far longer than they should.<br><br>Given this, I think that the management team at Yahoo! is doing a decent job of holding things together in light of changes at the very top of the organization, and a significant amount of reshuffling and re-prioritization of projects needed to return our focus to things that will result in long-term value creation. It may be that these changes came too late, but there have been very positive developments, internally, over the last six to nine months.<br><br>Unfortunately, this message is not getting across to shareholders and the public in spite of numerous attempts to offer proof that things have changed (for some reason - maybe it's like the boy who cried ""Wolf!""?). And this is the only caution I would throw to anyone thinking of working here. The recent M&amp;A-oriented publicity and Icahn's corporate raider trouble-making has posed more of a threat and distraction for us and our shareholders than Google's business model. That we are still delivering anything is something of a testament to management's ability to keep us focused on what we've been hired to do, for sure, but it is much more likely that we're still at it because most Yahoo! employees really care about their work and love this company.","Stay focused on delivering value-creating projects and funding those initiatives that show the highest probability for delivering results. Stand by your decisions and stand up for what's best for our stakeholders - including our shareholders, but also our users, advertisers, resellers, channel partners, and employees - and we will win."
"""Nothing special""",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,," Jun 23, 2008",Current,Software Engineer,"London, England (UK)",Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Full-time,,"“The best reason to work at Yahoo! is very simple: the people who work there. I haven't worked before at a place with so many bright, genuine, and good people. Many of them I now consider friends, some very close friends, and feel genuine loss when I see them leave. The daily interactions with my co-workers are the primary reason I have stayed with Yahoo! so long. In addition, the company offers a broad spectrum of products and projects, and allows a decent flexibility to switch between teams or projects. That is if one is inclined to do so. It has definitely helped me broaden my scope of experience, while still feeling excited and engaged about new opportunities.”","“The organization still feels very convoluted and there is little visibility into the decision making process, at least in many teams, certainly not all. In general, my experience has been that most decisions are made in and by the ""Product"" team, which also likes to call themselves ""Product Owners."" It has always struck me as odd to operate in such a way, since the company is thriving to be an innovator. It begs the question if it shouldn't be the talented people who work there to make the right product decisions. The ""Product Team"" should be the sum of the people working on a project, with shared ownership and responsibilities. It is one of those details I have always found the most limiting and frustrating in delivering a great experience for the many Yahoo! users out there.”","“My advice to senior management would be to focus more on their job, while I will focus on mine and deliver as best as I can. Ideally, senior management should be focused on appropriately staffing and budgeting business opportunities and ensuring the right people are doing their job. All too often I found senior management engaged on a level of detail that was overbearing. In the end it slows everything down and leads to products that were designed, not by the most qualified people, but rather by those who mostly interested in their personal career benefits and catering to some people in senior management. Again, this is certainly not the rule, but something one will be able to observe when staying at Yahoo! for some time.”"
"""Yahoo! Good place to work in, but management needs improvement!!""",4.0,4.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,," Jun 12, 2008",Current,Technical Lead QA,Bengaluru (India),Yes,Neutral,Neutral,Full-time,More than a year,"The work environment is the best and good for innovation and work.<br>Work environment is kept open and the management takes are of being open and of a joyful nature. The career oppurtunity in Yahoo! is tremendous, if we look at th way we are growing in certain areas. This develops a good environment, as personal growth is also given time for the individual. Compensation and perks are also great, we have facilities like pick and drop from the home and also a work from home culture, which lets us do our personal work, if required. Recognition in the form of awards is also a good way to check the progress of the person. Top management recognizes you for good work done, when it does proliferate up from the leads and the manager.","Communication between the teams and a rising insecurity within the members of what will happen.<br>The environment induces a feeling of well being and gives us time to innovate and relax, the only problem being that due to the realse cycles being too short and not enough staff trained to keep up with the same, it tends to become a place where the innovation is stifled. Only some whose projects are not active make the innovation. While the rest of the people are given away to obscurity. This is a practise which makes the people feel that they are not actually working on what they wish to and make them dull. Instead of being productive, they start to become unproductive in the short run itself. Awards have started getting too politically motivated and go to those who know how to market themselves and not to the exact deserving candidates. Due to the influx required to fill places, we have started lowering the standards at which we choose candidates. This should not be done anytime, as it will start getting more undeserving candidates, who are more interested in the perks rather than the work.","Please be more communicative. Also, try and build an environment of sharing within the teams, instead of keeping things hidden from one team to the next. Duplicacy and waste of time is the only thing that ensues from this. Also, keep the rewards and compensation system transparent so that there is no resentment in the engineerings as to why they were not deserving for the same."
